# DCGAN_FaceGeneration

Context: I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled Building Generative Adversarial Networks.

The Jupyter notebook presents a DCGAN built for the purpose of generating new images of human faces, as well as the procedures for training it with a processed CelebA dataset.
